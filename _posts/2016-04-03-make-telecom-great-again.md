**The Telecommunications industry, (when it comes to Small-to-Medium Business Markets) is broken and here’s why.**

- Customer dissatisfaction
- Long term contracts – “I need an attorney to get me out of this one..”
- Outsourced support and help desk – “I can’t understand a word he is saying”
- Outages – “My service is down and no one is responding!”
- Inability to decipher invoices – “I have no idea how much we’re actually paying”
- Technical information overload – “Can you repeat that 3 more times please?”
- Not enough standardization – “I have no idea how to use this”
- Horrible implementation – “Why does this work sometimes and not other times?”
- Lack of training – “I automatically hate it because I don’t know how to use it”
- Failure to manage customer expectations – “Why do I have to pay for this??”
- Improperly and/or uneducated sales people – “I don’t know what that is but I think I need it”
- Cumbersome sales cycle – “It only took 3 months to get service installed!”
- Unable to get answers to questions/issues – “I opened a ticket 4 hours ago..”
- Hidden fees – “Why is my bill now X dollars if you quoted me X dollars before??”

This “Get and Forget” type of business model is getting old and and is completely flawed in many ways. VOXO employs a much different type of service offering in hopes to make telecom suck much less.

**SOLUTION** (only for the lucky ones)

**A Get and Keep business model**

1. **Incorporating a slow growth strategy.**
The volume/numbers are for the fatties. Strategic business relationships are for organically growing telecom companies (and helps you sleep at night knowing you are actually helping someone).

2. **Focusing on the local market.**
Offering a managed telephone service requires hands-on interaction (plain and simple).

3. **Employ support personnel that have actually installed the equipment they will be supporting.**
What good is a technical support agent that doesn’t know how to use the technology installed by the company they work for? Wouldn’t they just have to hand the issue off to yet another redundant employee who may finally resolve the issue(best case scenario)? Proper training is critical here as it ultimately saves money in the long run.

4. **Hand-picking the right size client to do business with.**
Taking anyone and everyone as a customer doesn’t allow this “get and keep” business model to scale properly. Pursuing medium to larger companies that employ actual company policies and sufficient technical staff is key to maintaining this culture. This allows the telecom company to maintain low overhead costs and in turn, very competitive financial offering/rates in the SMB markets.

5. **Encouraging long term relationships (NOT based on long term contracts).**
Long term contracts just make people mad. Smaller and more agile telecom companies should rely on their reputations in order to grow organically and maintain a certain level of customer satisfaction. A bad reputation can ruin a business and this differentiator is what allows smaller telecom companies to stand out over competition. Trust is sometimes an issue with smaller telecom companies, so offering a no-risk value proposition helps build confidence and assurability. No-risk means the customer is not immediately wrapped up in a long term contract. The super salesy guy goes away. In many cases, they do get the job done, but a prospect honestly doesn’t want to speak to this guy. The prospect wants to speak to the person(s) that will be installing/implementing and supporting them during their long term business relationship. After all, this business model doesn’t include badgering  the prospect, so there is not a job opening for Mr. Salsey. Furthermore, it is impossible for this type of salesperson to setup (and properly manage expectations) a long term relationship because of his/her numbers- driven agenda.

6. **Properly Managing expectations.**
Telling the customer what they will pay every single month (without fluctuation) for the services including taxes and additional fees is vital for maintaining a longer relationship. Easily readable invoices are a must.

7. **Provide proper training (and plenty of hand-holding).**
The customer is not the expert and you shouldn’t expect them to be. Educate the customer and empower them to make their own decisions based on knowledgeable recommendations and experience. Answering the phone when a customer calls is of the utmost importance when an issue arises (even if it’s just to let them know the issue is being worked on).

This lightweight business model obviously doesn’t create a $200M company overnight but it does solve the problems outlined in this article (for some lucky businesses) as well as creates additional economical and financial advantages to running a successful company in which people are actually (as foreign as this seems) satisfied with telecom.

**This article was written for two reasons:**

1. Accountability for VOXO (and its staff) as it supports the goals and business strategy that VOXO has set out to achieve. We are not perfect and will never be. We do however strive to be better as we continue focusing on the core values that got us where we are today and business model that is VOXO.

2. I couldn’t sleep until it was done.
