**VOXO Features: Grouping Extensions**

For those of our customers who have signed up for direct access to our web portal, we have a great tool that allows you to group extensions together by department and location so that you can locate and manage them more easily.

![][1]

How to group your extensions:

**Step 1:** Login to the VOXO portal.

**Step 2:** Select "Extensions" from the left-hand menu.

**Step 3:** Select the extension you would like to group.

**Step 4:** Scroll to the bottom of the screen, and select/create the Branch and Department desired for the extension. Repeat this step with every extension you want to group.

**Step 5:** To be sure the extensions are grouped correctly, from the extension page, click on the double arrow icon on the far right of the screen. You will see the image attached below. To switch back to the regular extension page, click the double arrow button, now at the bottom of the window.

This is one of the many tools we offer for those with web portal access to simplify the maintenance of your account. Check back for regular updates and how-to's!

**Email to Fax**

![iphonefax1][2]

Available today, is the ability to send faxes via email. VOXO already supports Fax To Email. Here is the difference:

Fax To Email: When an incoming fax gets delivered to an email address from a fax machine.

Email To Fax: When a fax is sent in an email as a PDF email attachment.

Email To Fax allows you to send faxes from your email. Fax machines are out-dated and obnoxious. With Email To Fax you don't have to worry about leaving your desk. Now you can send faxes from your desktop or mobile device on the go. Don't worry, VOXO will send notifications containing the status of the fax you just sent and will retry the fax automatically if failed. You can also view the faxes in your account here.

Here's How It Works:

I want to send a fax to 213-294-2943. The file that I want to send is a PDF on my computer. In my email client (Desktop or Mobile) I will setup the email like so:

To: send@voxofax.com

Subject: 2132942943

Attach a PDF

**Missed Call Display**

![missed01][4]

By default, the phone will display missed calls whether the call came from a ring group, virtual extension, shared line, or direct. VOXO has introduced an enhancement that prevents the phone from displaying a call as missed if the call was picked up by someone else in the ring group. This is a much more intuitive approach to incoming calls because we don't want to display calls that are not truly missed.

Here's How It Works:

When someone calls your public telephone number and multiple extensions ring at once, by default the call will show as missed on your phone even though another extension picked up the call. After adding the missed call enhancement, that is no longer the case. Calls will not show as missed!

In the recent call list, this is the indicator that is displayed next to a missed call:
