#### ENHANCEMENTS & PLUGINS

Using jekyll seo for social media sharing and general SEO.

Uing somewhat non-conventional way of creating pages. Decided it was easier to sperate pages by adding folders instead of using jekyll permalinks

Put css in _includes so they can be injected in the html files (to eleminate additional http calls)

Optimized images

Google PageSpeed score of 89% for desktop and mobile
