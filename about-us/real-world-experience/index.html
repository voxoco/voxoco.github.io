										<p>VoIP carries several advantages over traditional telephony. It’s hard to remember, while you’re struggling with configurations and suppliers, that you’re benefiting from a complete new approach to voice communication for the 21st century. Saying
											goodbye to the phone on your desk is only the start of it; for one, call costs are generally substantially lower using VoIP and SIP contracts. The real world benefits can seem abstract at the start but become more tangible in practice.</p>
										<p>Phones being linked to contact lists and popping information up when you receive a call is a simple example of the benefits in the world of customer relationship management (CRM), but even that first step can be gold dust to hard-pressed businesses
											in competitive sectors.</p>
										<p>Using one set of cables to deliver your computer data and voice traffic is appealing, too, if hard to achieve. So is the notion of digital presence, where your once-humble phone system can tell you where your staff are sitting, if they are busy,
											on the phone, on their mobile, in the car, and so on.</p>
										<p>All these advantages have their own buzzwords: “a fully converged, CRM-integrated, DPM-friendly voice platform” is frequently the promise made in the industry. At VOXO, we will lay out the reality of what’s achievable in your business, and then
											make it possible by leveraging our years of experience both inside and outside of telecom. We have what it takes to deliver high quality, consistent results.</p>
