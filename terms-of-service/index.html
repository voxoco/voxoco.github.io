On occasions such as this you will be required to give the dispatcher the location of your emergency in order to receive emergency service assistance.</p>
<p>Enhanced 911 service is not available to every location within the United States at this time. For locations where e911 is not currently available, you will be required to announce the location of your emergency to the PSAP dispatcher.</p>
<p>Due to the nature and instability of VoIP networks, we cannot and do not guarantee your emergency call will complete. Loss of power, Internet access and or several other conditions may cause 911 to be inoperable. We have no control over those types of situations therefore are not held liable. VOXO will do everything within their power to prevent service outages within its network.</p>

Failure to set the correct caller ID value will result in a non-refundable $85 surcharge per 911 call.</p>
<p>We have added an extension to our network which all VOXO users may call to test their Caller ID value. At any time, you may test your outbound caller ID value by dialing ’811? through our network.</p>
<p>By using VOXO’s Enhanced 911 service, Customer agrees that VOXO, its contractors, executives, members, customers, agents, employees, carriers, 911 providers, and any anyone else associated with VOXO is not held liable for emergency calls failing, even if it is determined that it is the fault of VOXO or its associates. Customer further agrees that they will notify their customers, contractors, agents, employees, associates, shareholders, partners, and anyone who may use the VOXO 911 service of our limitations and will only permit use of the VOXO service by persons who agree to not hold VOXO or Customer liable.</p>
<p>Customer will be charged a regulatory recovery fee of $1.49 per month for each DID submitted to the e911 database. This fee is non-refundable. Failure to enable e911 service will result in a non-refundable $85 surcharge per 911 call.</p>
